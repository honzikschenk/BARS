/**
 * @brief Calculates the inverse kinematics to move a foot to a specific coordinate relative to the body.
 * @author Honzik Schenk
 * 
 * BodyToFootIK is a library that calculates the inverse kinematics necessary to move a foot to a specific
 * coordinate relative to the center of the body. The library goes off the assumption that there are two
 * legs and each have a 3-axis hip joint, a 1-axis knee joint, and a 1-axis ankle joint. The library also
 * assumes that the legs are symmetrical.
